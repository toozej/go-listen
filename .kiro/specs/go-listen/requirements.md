# Requirements Document

## Introduction

go-listen is a web application that allows users to search for artists and automatically add their top 5 songs to designated "incoming" playlists on Spotify. The application integrates with the existing Go starter project scaffold and provides both a web interface and API endpoint for artist management. It includes duplicate detection, playlist management, and comprehensive logging while following web security best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for an artist by name and have their top 5 songs automatically added to a selected incoming playlist, so that I can quickly discover and organize new music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an artist name in the text box THEN the system SHALL perform fuzzy matching to find the closest artist match
2. WHEN an artist is found THEN the system SHALL retrieve the artist's top 5 songs from Spotify
3. WHEN songs are retrieved THEN the system SHALL add them to the user-selected incoming playlist
4. WHEN songs are successfully added THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with details of what was added
5. IF no artist match is found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from my existing "incoming" playlists through a searchable dropdown, so that I can organize music into the appropriate playlist.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL populate the dropdown with playlists from the "Incoming" folder in Spotify
2. WHEN a user types in the dropdown THEN the system SHALL filter playlists based on the search term
3. WHEN a playlist is selected THEN the system SHALL display the Spotify embedded player for that playlist
4. IF no "Incoming" folder exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an embedded Spotify player for my selected playlist, so that I can immediately listen to the music I'm organizing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a playlist is selected from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL display the Spotify embedded player
2. WHEN the playlist changes THEN the embedded player SHALL update to show the new playlist
3. IF the playlist is empty THEN the player SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be notified if an artist's songs have already been added to prevent duplicates, with an option to override, so that I can avoid cluttering my playlists while still having control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to add songs THEN the system SHALL check if the artist's top 5 songs already exist in the target playlist
2. IF songs already exist THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating previous addition with timestamp
3. WHEN duplicate songs are detected THEN the system SHALL provide an "Add Anyway" override button
4. WHEN the override button is clicked THEN the system SHALL add the songs regardless of duplicates
5. WHEN using the API THEN a force parameter SHALL allow bypassing duplicate detection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the system programmatically through an API endpoint, so that I can integrate it with other tools and scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending a POST request to /api/add-artist THEN the system SHALL accept artist name and playlist parameters
2. WHEN the API request is valid THEN the system SHALL return JSON response with operation results
3. WHEN using the force parameter THEN the system SHALL bypass duplicate detection
4. IF the API request is invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive logging of all operations, so that I can track usage and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an artist is searched THEN the system SHALL log the search term and matched artist
2. WHEN songs are added THEN the system SHALL log which songs were added to which playlist
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with appropriate severity levels
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request details and responses

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web application to work seamlessly across all my devices, so that I can manage playlists from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and usable
2. WHEN accessing the application on tablets THEN the interface SHALL adapt appropriately to the screen size
3. WHEN accessing the application on desktop THEN the interface SHALL utilize the available screen space effectively
4. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the interface SHALL adjust accordingly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the application to be protected against common web vulnerabilities, so that my data and the system remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting forms THEN the system SHALL validate all input data for injection attacks
2. WHEN making state-changing requests THEN the system SHALL implement CSRF protection
3. WHEN receiving requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all data
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log the activity and respond appropriately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user in an internal network, I want to access the application without complex authentication, so that I can use it seamlessly within my trusted environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the system SHALL not require user authentication
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL not require authentication tokens
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL be ready to serve requests immediately without auth setup
